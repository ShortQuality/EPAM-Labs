Example of enter:
1)	1 1 1 + 2 2 2 

	Sum=(3,3,3)
	
2)	(1,1,1) * 2 2 2

	Scalar Mult = 6

3)	1 2 3 v 2 2 2

	Vectors Mult = (-2, 4, -2)

Operations between vectors:
"+", "-", "="(vector comparison), "*"(scalar multiplication between vectors or vector and number), "v"(vector multiplication).
   
Separators between coordinates can be: ",", ".", " ".
